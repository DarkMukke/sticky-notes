# Sticky Notes Privacy Notice

Sticky Notes sends out statistical information to an external server that
includes **only** the following data:

* Your site's URL
* Sticky Notes version
* Action type: install / update

You can choose to not send your site's URL by setting the fullStats option
to FALSE in `app/config/app.php`. However, it is strongly recommended that
you leave this value as TRUE.

Please note that your site's URL will never be published and is purely used
for statistical purposes. It is stored securely and is encrypted with a
strong hash.
